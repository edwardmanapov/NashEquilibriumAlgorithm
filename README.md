# Algorithm in Searching of Nash Equilibrium in Multi-player Games
A research is made on algorithmic game theory. I designed and implemented
a algorithm which performs a search of Nash equilibrium in two-player
and multi-player games using brute-force technique; this involves a basic knowledge
background, which is covered properly.
The source language of the algorithm is objective C, beside this pseudo-code is
provided for users not in contact with object oriented languages. We test this algorithm
in case of many game rounds. And, show how it performs based on the time and space
complexity.
